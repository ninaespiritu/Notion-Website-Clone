# Notion-Website-Clone

Cloning Notion's homepage as close to identical as possible, using HTML and CSS. This project was an exercise to learn the basics of HTML & CSS, as well as how to make a website responsive.

Original commits were made as part of Code Nation Bootcamp repository and can be found [here.](https://github.com/ninaespiritu/CodeNation-Bootcamp/commits/main/W2_HTML-CSS/2_CSS_Webclone)
